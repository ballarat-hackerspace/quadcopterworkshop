Lesson 1
========
Outline

* Check parts
* Transmitter familiarity
* Simulator setup

Checking your parts list
========================
You should have:

1. Four ESCs
2. Four Motors
3. One Frame Kit
4. One Flight Controller
5. 2x LEDs
6. Various Screws and Nuts
8. Transmitter and receiver (if you opted to get one)

Your transmitter
================
* Turnigy 9X Features (opensource, programmable, can take new firmware)
* Run through simulator setup


Simulator
=========
* A simulator lets you practice using controls without crashing
* Using it with your own controller helps prevent "freakouts" and "blanks"

Choices
=======

1. Freerider FPV 
 - Has a Line of Sight Mode
 - $5, although has a Demo
2. Hotprops
 - Free
 - Clients for Win, Mac, Linux
3. Liftoff
 - Most actively in development and getting new features
 - Best looking sim
4. DRL FPV Simulator
 - Free
 - Train on "real" courses like the XDC Las Vegas Neon course
5. Realflight
 - 3D Model in a 2D Photo Sphere
 - Kind of more built for planes and Line of Sight
 
Let's give Freerider a go. 

Flashing the firmware of your transmitter
=========================================

The Turnigy 9X and Taranis X9D share a lot of features, the most important being programmable firmware.

* Flash firmware (Latest OpenTX)
* Setup "Sim mode" with the 0-100 range on their controls, Create a profile for it. Turn antenna off for better batt life

Setup Simulator with your computer
==================================

* The usb cable connection can be a bit finicky on windows
* Power up the transmitter
* Plug in USB Cable (depending on transmitter, should give you an icon indication on LCD)
* (Win) check game controller is appearing in "Game Controllers" list
* If you have more troubles, try using a Windows VM, more heavily documented.
